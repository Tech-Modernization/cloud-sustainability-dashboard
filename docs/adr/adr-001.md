# ADR-001: MVP Visualisation Dashboard Technology

> STATUS: Proposed

## Context

For the visualising the cloud sustainability data, an analytics and visualization web system needs to be included as the
dashboard front-end for data users.

## Decision

For MVP, AWS Managed Grafana service was chosen as the analytics dashboard.

## Rationale

The long-term vision of the Cloud Sustainability Dashboard is to support multiple Cloud providers, therefore cloud
specific services (e.g. AWS Quicksight) were discarded and only OSS offerings were evaluated. An alternative suitable
application for supporting the type of visualisation needed would be Apache Superset, however, due to MVP time
constraint, a managed solution would increase the delivery speed. Grafana dashboard, besides OSS, is offered as managed
service by AWS.

## Consequences

Deploying AWS Managed Grafana with IaC has limited support yet, therefore there are several manual steps needed for end
to end setup as described in [Dashboard Usage](../deployment.md#dashboard-usage) on the Deployment guide. The service
also has a restrictive pricing model and it does not seem as mature as other AWS offerings.
